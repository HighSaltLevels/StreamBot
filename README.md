# StreamBot
This is a bot that I've decided to create so that I can store and stream youtube videos.

## This is still in Alpha
Sorry, but this bot is still under development. I'm working as fast as I can, but this project is just a hobby after all. If you would like to add this Bot to your discord, DM me at `HighSaltLevels#9844`.

### What can this bot do?
This bot has 5 commands:
```
!add <name> <url>      -> Add a YouTube video <url> as <name>
!delete <name>         -> Delete a YouTube video that you named <name>
!show                  -> Show all YouTube videos in your video list
!play <name> <channel> -> Play the specified video in the specified channel
```

Please note that when naming a video, you'll have to use a single word, camelCase, or snake_case as `StreamBot` is only expecting a single word not separated by any white space. I plan to fix this later, but for right now, I just want to get all the core functionality down :sweat_smile:
